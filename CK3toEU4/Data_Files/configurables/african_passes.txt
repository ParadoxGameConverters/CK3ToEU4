# We tend to sterilize african passes into subsaharan basin to slow down voracious speed at which europeans or north africans tend to expand
# southwards and eat entire africa.

# Each pass has two ends. If the same country holds both ends of a pass, or if those ends are in HRE, the pass will not be sterilized.

# To disable this behavior simply comment or delete relevant lines. Feel free to add new ones if that would suit your need.
