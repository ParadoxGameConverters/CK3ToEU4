# Ethos lines must be in the format: ethos = { ethos_name effect1_name effect1_# effect2_name effect2# }
# The convertor assumes exactly 5 strings in exactly that order inbetween the ethos brackets

# Tradition lines must be in the format: ethos = { tradition_name effect1_name effect1_# effect2_name effect2# }
# The convertor does NOT assume exactly 5 strings, each effect must be immediately followed by its number.

# NOTE: All decimal values need a leading integer. .2 will cause an effect to fail to appear in game, 0.2 will work.
