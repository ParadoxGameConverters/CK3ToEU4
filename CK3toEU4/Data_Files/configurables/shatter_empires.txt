# Empires posted here will be shattered if this file is enabled by the configuration. 
# They *should* be independent and obviously have some vassals.
# While this setting can apply even to kingdoms if shatter level is duchies, don't go about 
# assigning duchies or lower.

# Here are a few examples, you can edit this to your liking and experiment.
# Do not list hre title here unless you selected "No HRE shattering" in configuration! 
# I.e., if you changed HRE mechanics empire to be Byzantium, do not shatter it here!
