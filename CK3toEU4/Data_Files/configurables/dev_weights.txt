# This file defines how buildings/building upgrades are weighted against EU4's dev.
# Provided defaults are reasonable for a standard 250-year game. If shorter, you may want to increase the numbers ever so slightly,
# or reduce them if you've been playing longer.

dev_from_building = 0.15
dev_from_holding = 1
dev_from_development = 0.15
dev_treshold = 50.0

# formula is: (sum of all building upgrades) * dev_from_building + (sum of holdings) * dev_from_holding + max(0, (dev - dev_treshold)) * dev_from_development

# If the world seems underdeveloped, try with dev_from_building = 0.3 or 0.35. dev_from_holding is usually fine as is, as well as dev from development.
