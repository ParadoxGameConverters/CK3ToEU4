# This file defines how buildings/building upgrades are weighted against EU4's dev.
# Provided defaults are reasonable for a standard 250-year game. If shorter, you may want to increase the numbers ever so slightly,
# or reduce them if you've been playing longer.

dev_from_building = 0.1
dev_from_barony = 0.3

# If the world seems underdeveloped, try with dev_from_building = 0.12 or 0.15. dev_from_barony is usually fine as is.
