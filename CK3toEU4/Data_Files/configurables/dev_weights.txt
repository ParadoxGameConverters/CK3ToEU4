# This file defines how buildings/building upgrades are weighted against EU4's dev.
# Provided defaults are reasonable for a standard 250-year game. If shorter, you may want to increase the numbers ever so slightly,
# or reduce them if you've been playing longer.

dev_from_building = 0.2
dev_from_holding = 0.4
dev_from_development = 0.2

# If the world seems underdeveloped, try with dev_from_building = 0.25 or 0.3. dev_from_holding is usually fine as is.
