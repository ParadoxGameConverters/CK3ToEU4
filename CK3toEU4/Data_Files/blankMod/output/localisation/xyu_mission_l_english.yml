 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_1_desc:0 "No matter what we worship, we must find Kin in those who share our beliefs and strengthen this sacred connection we have in-between."
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_2_title:0 "Show of Strength"
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_2_desc:0 "Circumstances have forced us to resort to blade once again. The hardships we now endure may propel our state into something mightier. We are no strangers to war, after all."
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_3_title:0 "Power in the Baltic"
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_3_desc:0 "Ever since the times of the Romans, us Balts were considered inferior peoples, even less noteworthy than barbarians. Time for us to make a stand and demonstrate the errors in such judgement."
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_4_title:0 "Reign in the Warlords"
 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_4_desc:0 "The pride of even the lowliest chief can prove to be a major obstacle in molding of a great state. Through benevolence or harsh measures, we must ensure that whims of nobles do not shroud our bright future."

 ck_eu_baltic_missions_1_task_5_desc:0 "Our ancestors were tribal peoples for centuries and now we once again stand at the crossroads of our future - will a King rule [Root.GetName] or shall it be a Republic? Such delicate question must not be left unanswered. "

 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_2_title:0 "Raider Fleet"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_2_desc:0 "In many cases, a good bounty can be discovered within the merciless winds and thundering waves. Why bother invading an enemy, when we can take their riches in the Sea?"

 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_3_desc:0 "Regardless of what wealth we bring home, a good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must also oversee growth of his own lands. Perhaps, with proper management, we can make [Root.GetName] a rich and self-sufficient country?"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_4_title:0 "Religious Pragmatism"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_4_desc:0 "The strength of [Root.Religion.GetName] lies in flexibility. The amount of Gods our people worship probably reaches hundreds, if not thousands.

 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_5_title:0 "Pagan Fury"
 ck_eu_europagan_missions_1_task_5_desc:0 "Many mighty Kings have risen and justified their atrocities towards pagans by referring to their 'Divine Right', given by their cruel God. Let us give them a proper lesson on theology."

 ck_eu_norse_missions_1_task_4_desc:0 "Germans, Slavs and even petty Balts continue their fruitless efforts at strengthening their position as major merchants in the Baltic Sea. Sadly for them, there is an already established overlord of this trade region - [Root.GetName]!"
 ck_eu_norse_missions_1_task_5_title:0 "Unrivaled Naval Industry"
 ck_eu_norse_missions_1_task_5_desc:0 "It seems that the demand for Naval Supplies will only grow in the future. We must secure enough of these resources to ensure our wealth and influence through them."

 ck_eu_euromuslim_missions_1_task_4_desc:0 "For nearly an entirety of Middle Ages noble city of Rome was in a disgusting state of decay with ancient monuments being dismembered brick by brick.

 ck_eu_euromuslim_missions_1_task_5_title:0 "Trail of Ibn Battuta"
 ck_eu_euromuslim_missions_1_task_5_desc:0 "Many brave and learned adventurers and scholars have traveled distant lands, capturing the culture and life of incredibly diverse peoples. This also opened new trade opportunities, strengthening the exchange of goods and technologies throughout Andalus, Egypt, Persia and India.

 ck_eu_jewish_missions_1_task_3_title:0 "High Priesthood"

Due to a lack of suitable candidates, this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the Jewish religious communities."
 ck_eu_jewish_missions_1_task_4_title:0 "Jewish Diaspora"
 ck_eu_jewish_missions_1_task_4_desc:0 "Our people are scattered throughout the World. We must build a new home for them and welcome them here!"
