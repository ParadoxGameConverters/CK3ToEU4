 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.1.t:0 "The [From.Religion.GetName] Reformation"
 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.1.desc:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has recieved a vision! In this vision the followers of the gods stood apart, and one by one they were swept aside by a mighty cross made of wood. Soon there were no followers of the gods left, and [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] saw Odin himself slowly fading. Suddenly there was a bright light, and there was Thor, smashing the wooden cross, and behind him stood all those swept aside, together destroying that which they were powerless against alone. Trusting in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] vision, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has established a new religious hierarchy. Additionally, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] has also tasked [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] most learned theologians with standardizing the great sagas so that there will be a single definitive edition of each. Collectively these standardized sagas are to be known as The Heilögu Sögurnar."

 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.2.desc:0 "The ancient [From.Religion.GetName] religion is under attack from foreign heathens! A great tale has been making the rounds, firing up the peasantry. Known simply as Amžina Ugnis, or "An Eternal Flame", this story, often performed by bards and mummers, raises the practicioners of [From.Religion.GetName] to a higher level than those that follow other beliefs. The strength of this religious upswell has forced a great conference of theologians. During the conference a few key leaders pushed forward a series of reforms, including a loose but unquestionable hierarchy, and the faith-wide acceptance of the Amžina Ugnis as the definitive holy text for the [From.Religion.GetName] faith."

 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.3.desc:0 "It is time for the hunted to become the hunters. Tired of the constant incursions from neighboring heretics and heathens, [From.Religion.GetName] theologians from across the land gathered together in a great assembly. There they consolidated the myths of the [From.Religion.GetName] into a single epic, The Kalevala. While working on the epic, the theologians decided upon a simple but clear hierarchy, ensuring that the foundations laid at the assembly would not be lost with time."

 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.4.desc:0 "Vaster than the sky, our faith is unassailable. Or so the [From.Religion.GetName] faithful were taught, but recently this undeniable fact has come under question as heretic and heathen forces encroach upon their holy lands. In response to these aggressions, a great congregation of theologians was called, and it was decided that it was time to strike back. A church hierarchy was formed, a great enumeration of the Holy Inscription Stones was ordered. Using the text gathered from these stones, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] commissioned a massive building project, a large mountain is to have an edited version of all sanctioned inscriptions enscribed upon it, and these chosen texts will collectively become the official tenants of the reformed [From.Religion.GetName] faith. This official collection is to be known simply as The Inscriptions."

 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.5.desc:0 "The news spread like wild-fire across all [From.Religion.GetName] lands. There was to be a synod of theologians, the size of which would be unprecedented. Omen readers everywhere had all read the exact same omens, that the gods and the cycles would soon be forgotten if there was no change. Gathered together, the theologians have reformed the [From.Religion.GetName] faith so that it is better equipped to face the challenges of the modern era. With a strict church hierarchy and an official compendium of holy myths and legends known simply as The Tales, the [From.Religion.GetName] faith has succesfully been reborn!"

The ancient [From.Religion.GetName] religion has been reformed, its teachings and prophecies have been weighted for their authenticity and compiled into a single volume, The Book of the Sun.

 ZZZ_enhanced_religion.7.desc:0 "Time marches on, and the followers of the [From.Religion.GetName] religion have become fearful that the old ways will fade away to be replaced by their more aggressive neighbors. In response to these fears, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has called a great conclave of the most learned theologians of the land. Through many sleepless days and nights, the conclave has emerged in agreement over several important religious matters including the standardization of the Mdodus and the organization of monks."

Challenging the Christian Church for domination across Europe for the first time in centuries, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has managed to restore a working hierarchy of Augurs and a codified belief system everymuch as detailed as its Christian and Islamic counterparts. No longer relegated to the past, the adherents of the Hellenic faith now look to the future."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.4.t:0 "Elder Leadership"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.4.d:0 "We have met and seen people who at first we mistook for our own. However, we soon realized that their ways were different from our own. They were more organized and their shamans all seemed to be trained in the same manner, with a structure that implies that some shamans rank higher than others. Surprisingly, all the shamans of these people accept this and follow their superiors without question. These people claim that once they were much like us, but that they have discovered greater truths about the universe and that in doing so they have been able to beat back those who would challenge the old ways."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.4.a:0 "And what are these greater truths?"
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.t:0 "The Horsemasters"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.d:0 "We knew that one could tame a horse and use it for everything ranging from message delivery to battle, but we did not realize that we did not know true mastery until we saw the followers of Tengri ride near [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They did things with their horses that we never thought possible. They attribute part of their people's success to Tengri, the god of the sky. These horsemasters have agreed to teach us how to better handle our own horses so long as we agree to offer our own thanks to Tengri."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.a:0 "May Tengri favour us."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.t:0 "The Great Defenders"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.d:0 "For many seasons we had heard of a people who had staunchly defended their ways, turning back every invader and ignoring all missionaries. No nation could break these people according to the rumours. We made inquiries and were able to meet some of these fabled peoples. They speak of their devotion to their gods, especially Divas, who rules over all others and Pelkkunas, god of thunder. They have shown us their rites and rituals and have encouraged us to emulate their ways so that we too may be granted the divine protection of Divas."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.a:0 "We shall be the Defenders of Pelkkunas."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.t:0 "The Hunters"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.d:0 "A group of hunters have come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], but these are no ordinary hunters. They dress in strange garb and speak a strange tongue. Through translators we have been able to determine that these hunters have come here on a sacred expedition. Their people believe that all animals have an Emuu, an ancestral mother who must be prayed to when you hunt. In order to ensure that the Emuus will be appeased, these hunters have been traveling to discover the names of new Emmu who are not native to their homeland and as such unknown to them. They have implored us to help them ensure that no animal is ever again hunted without first appeasing the Emmus."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.a:0 "A noble cause."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.t:0 "The Three Tiered Tree"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.d:0 "Visitors from a far off land have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They bring with them an interesting idea, that the world is perched on a tree, specifically in the middle. The upper branches of this massive "world tree" is where the heavenly bodies lie. We men lie among the middle branches and trunk and at the bottom of the tree extending into the roots is the underworld where the dead go. These visitors have argued most strongly on this point and at times have insisted that we too recognize the world tree and man's place on it."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.a:0 "So we lie in the center then?"
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.t:0 "Zun The Lawgiver"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.d:0 "We have met people who worship the sun, who they say is the god Zun. Zun is the lawgiver and judges all. Men must aspire to be just and kind in order to live up to the expectations of Zun. Those who commit heinous crimes may be submitted to Zun directly for judgement, by leaving them alone in a desert with no food or water for one week. If the person is found alive after this time, they are deemed to have been judged fit for rehabilitation by Zun. It is said that no-one who has survived has returned the same. Their insistance on justice and fairness has struck a chord with many of our people."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.a:0 "Praise the sun!"
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.t:0 "The Divine Presence"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.d:0 "Strangers from a far-away land have recently encountered us, they bring with them their beliefs. They claim that in order to achieve true happiness in one must dedicate their life to prayer, diligence and devotion. With these one could do many things, including banishing demons. These strangers also claim that houses must be built with extra seats in them for the protecting gods. Already we have heard reports of extra chairs being built in houses near where the strangers visited."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.a:0 "We must study this further."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.t:0 "The Olympians"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.d:0 "Traveling scholars have arrived in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They spend their days arguing with everyone and anyone, oftentimes leading circling arguements that end up with the scholar's partner arguing against what he had stood for just an hour previously. These scholars claim to be the honourary descendants of a long tradition that began centuries ago in a small place called "Glees". They already have a devoted following who have begun to copy them in style and dress, with many even going so far as to join them in their religious practices, which concern making sacrifices to a large number of gods who supposedly live on a large mountain far away called "Olympus"."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.a:0 "An unexamined life is not worth living."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.t:0 "The Other"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.d:0 "As we have gradually seen more of the world, we have come to realize that there are many peoples who are similar to us, even if they are not perfect mirrors. They have their own rituals, gods and beliefs. As we have interacted with these people, there has naturally been an exchange of culture. It is not unusual nowadays to find local families making a sacrifice to a god known mainly in a land that would take months if not years to reach."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.a:0 "We are more alike than we are different."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.aa:0 "So long as they follow the true traditions."
    ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.aa.tt:0 "A large number of Samaritan immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.ab:0 "So long as they are true believers."
    ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.ab.tt:0 "A large number of Karaite immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.49.ab:0 "So long as they follow the right path."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.49.ac:0 "So long as they know truth."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.t:0 "Shamans Approve of Hierarchy"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.d:0 "It appears that our attempts to organize the shamans into a viable hierarchy has been met with success. It appears that most shamans like the new order that has been imposed as it standardizes their practices meaning that they can go anywhere without having to worry about upsetting the local population. In addition, many find a hierarchal structure to be reassuring, as it leaves no questions as to who has greater authority in cases of dispute. Overall this has greatly increased not only the shamans's happiness, but our people's as well."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.t:0 "Shamans Disapprove of Hierarchy"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.d:0 "It appears that our attempts to organize the shamans into a viable hierarchy has been met with disaster. Use to having almost total authority within their area of control, many shamans have been chafing under what they call "an overly restricting system". There have been inumerable cases of shamans simply ignoring their supposed superiors and acting as they wished. These disgruntled shamans have also used their sway over the people to slander [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.a:0 "Wasn't a hierarchy supposed to stop this nonsense?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.t:0 "Veneration of the Ancestors"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.d:0 "Our people have always honoured those who came before, and know that they watch over us still, guiding those who seek them. In order to honour our beloved ancestors, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has conducted a large ceremony in their honour. Attended by thousands, the ceremony went better than expected. Even better, the harvest has been unusually good this year, and many attribute it to the pleasure of the ancestors."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.a:0 "May they continue to watch over us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.t:0 "Clamor For Reform"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.d:0 "Many of our subjects in [Root.GetName] have been exposed to the reforms that have been proposed in order to supposedly bring ourselves into the modern age. Rather than being repelled by these radical changes, the citizens of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been embraced the idea with gusto and several key figures have risen up in support of the reforms. If we wish to put a stop to this, we will need to act sooner rather than later."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.a:0 "Reform can be good."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.b:0 "Let's nip this in the bud."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.t:0 "Sacrifices For Divas"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.d:0 "Things have not been going amazing in [Root.GetName] recently. The harvest has been poor and several prominent trading companies have had unexpected setbacks. Nothing that defines a crisis just yet, but the people demand that we take some kind of action. A popular demand has been for the government to offer a large sacrifice to Divas, chief of the gods. Should we risk Divas's wrath?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.a:0 "It's worth a try."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.b:0 "A waste of time and money."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.t:0 "Sacrifice Successful"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.d:0 "Ever since we made our sacrifice to Divas a while back, things have been going exceptionally well. The poor harvest has been forgotten behind the wonderful one we just had and the trading companies have recovered their losses and then some. With patriotism running at an all time our recruiters have had a huge influx of new recruits eager to repay their good fortune with service. It appears that Divas has taken kindly to our offerings and has rewarded us accordingly."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.a:0 "Glory to Divas!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.t:0 "Sacrifice Unsuccessful"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.d:0 "It does not appear that Divas has looked kindly upon our sacrifice. The harvest has continued to be poor and several previously wealthy merchant companies have now gone completely bankrupt. The people have not looked kindly on us for their troubles."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.a:0 "Maybe we should've sacrificed cows instead of goats..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.t:0 "The Great Defence of [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.d:0 "We have come under attack by heathens and heretics who would dare defile our sacred ways and our traditions. As proud followers of Divas and Pelkkunas we are obligated to defend [Root.GetName] to the last man."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.a:0 "Rise countrymen, and save [Root.GetName]!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.t:0 "Romuvans Migrate to [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.d:0 "It appears that the small Romuvan community in [Root.GetCapitalName], [Root.GetName] is famous among the greater Romuvan community. We have been approached by a rather large group of Romuvan migrants who wish to join their kin in [Root.GetName]. They have promised to work for the state in exchange for our acquiescense, using their knowledge of fortifications to improve the province's defencibility."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.a:0 "We welcome our Romuvan brethren and sistren!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.b:0 "We don't want their kind here."
 
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.t:0 "Uncontrollable Poaching"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.desc:0 "Recently [Root.GetName] has become a haven for poachers and game hunters. These people do not kill for need, instead they kill only for profit or sport. A staggering amount of meat that could have fed whole villages has gone to waste and the people have grown restless at the continued inaction of the local authorities. If we do not take action, we risk angering the Emmus, the ancestral mother spirits of the animals and our own people."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.a:0 "Send in the military to clear them out."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.b:0 "The local authorities just need to be "reminded" of their duties."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.c:0 "That reminds me, I wanted a new ivory statue."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.d:0 "So, how do *I* get involved?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.t:0 "Animal Population Boom in [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.d:0 "For the last few years [Root.GetName] has had an almost unprecedented level of animal growth. Many see this as the Emmus thanking us for ridding [From.GetName] of poachers awhile back. Regardless of the reason, the huge boom has provided extra meat to the local population and more animals means more animal byproducts. Lucrative animal byproducts."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.a:0 "The Emmus have honoured us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.t:0 "Poaching Spreads"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.desc:0 "Believing that the rise in poaching incidents would be temporary we chose to not take any significant actions against the poachers. However, this fad does not seem to be dying as it has spread to [Root.GetName] and now they too have a poaching epidemic. Should we finally put our foot down?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.a:0 "That's it, send in the military."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.b:0 "*Sigh*, how much is this going to cost?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.c:0 "Kill them, all of them."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.d:0 "So you're saying lion heads are on sale again?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.e:0 "Or we can take advantage of the obvious demand."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.desc:0 "Recently [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName], heir of [Root.GetName] decided to go out on a grand hunt with [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] retainers. The [Root.Heir.GetTitle]'s expedition almost met with disaster when [Root.Heir.GetName] ended up seperated from the rest chasing their quarry. [Root.Heir.GetName] ended up in a clearing in the woods. Alone, [Root.Heir.GetName] was suddenly faced with a lion that had been resting nearby. Thinking quickly, [Root.Heir.GetName]..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.a:0 "Used the sidearm [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] had kept handy."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.b:0 "Used [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] horse as bait to give [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] time to take on the Lion."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.c:0 "Drew [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] sword and took it head on."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.64.t:0 "Death of the Royal Lion"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.64.d:0 "The royal family pet lion, once wrestled into submission and taken home as a prize, has finally died of old age. The royal family mourns the loss of their unusual pet and friend and a formal funeral ceremony was held for the lion's burial in the Royal Garden."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.66.d:0 "Our adoption of Slavic practices has had a most unusual and unexpected result. Dancing styles popular in Slavic lands have become incredibly popular here, especially among the nobility and well to do. This has made the people of our court a highly in-demand commodity not only in the lesser courts of our own country, but in the courts of neighboring countries as well. We have been able to use this opportunity to make connections and find out pertinent information through our court."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.66.a:0 "May the dance go on!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.t:0 "Festival Forgotten"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.d:0 "How it happened we do not know. [Root.Ruler.GetTitle] [Root.Ruler.GetName] had it clearly marked off on the official royal calender, initial preparations were made and guest lists were drawn up. Yet somehow it was all forgotten and the holy day came and went with no official event from the government. Perhaps this wouldn't normally be such a problem, but recently a Slavic delegation accused our government of only superficially following their faith, that we did not appreciate their holy rites and rituals. Now that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has forgotten this event, it appears to lend credence to the delegation's accusations."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.a:0 "It's just a day..."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.69.d:0 "It seems that Tengri has blessed us. Our latest stock of horses has been exceptional, they are far stronger, faster and robust than our normal stock. We have been training them for our army and have been extremely impressed, the enemy will not stand a chance!"

The breeder was amazed, explaining that the horse in question had been unruly since the day he was born and allowed none to lead him, never mind ride him. Pleased, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] took the stallion home and soon found that the horse was unmatched in speed or power and would only allow [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] or [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family to ride him."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.d:0 "A man is dragged in front of you and you can feel the heat of anger coursing through your body as the charges are read to you. The man in question is a powerful trader who frequents your court and often invests in the government. There is no doubt that this man must face the judgement of Zun, but his contributions are just so useful and without him we will surely lose some revenue, at least in the sort term."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.a:0 "All must face the Judgement of Zun."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.b:0 "Surely you have the wrong man?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.c:0 "We never indulged in his schemes."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.75.t:0 "Judged Returns"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.75.d:0 "When a man or a women is sent to be judged by Zun, most people expect to never see that person again. Zun is harsh and since the punishment is rare, returnees are even rarer, yet it now seems that we have one. Driven out into the desert for the murder of their spouse, they were able to return to us. However, like most returnees, they did not return unchanged. It is said that their personality has changed completely but that they have become extraordinarily good at what they do. They have offered their services at our court as: "

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.75.c:0 "a recruit master."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.76.d:0 "We could not believe it when we heard it, our beloved heir [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has been accused of murder. Apparently [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] was out drinking and when a peasant refused to give up his seat, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] murdered him in a drunken rage. Although [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] now deeply regrets the action, it was seen by a large number of witnesses and as the representative of Zun the Lawgiver on Earth, we are expected to dole out the proper punishment regardless of station. For this offense, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] should be judged by Zun, taken out to the desert with no food or water and left there to see if they can survive."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.76.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName], how could you?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.76.b:0 "I see no problem here."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.77.t:0 "Heir Returns"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.77.d:0 "To the surprise of many, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has survived [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] judgement. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] stumbled into [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] barely conscious and collapsed as soon as they were approached, but it is undoubtedly [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName]. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is different though, like most who are judged by Zun, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned a different person. Regardless, news of [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName]'s survival has spread like wildfire throughout [Root.GetName] and the people now see [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] as having been annointed by Zun himself."

Yet we cannot help but feel that something is missing. We have turned to those who came before and we have realized what we were missing. We do not have a proper temple to the gods, not one that can be compared to the ancients anyway. This must be fixed at once, it will be a long and expensive process, but it must be done."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.84.d:0 "Every now and then one should ask the gods for their favour. In order to do this, one must sacrifice an animal and have a trained expert, usually a shaman, read the bones and entrails of the animals. In doing so, they will be able to determine the favour of the gods. The gods tend to prefer larger sacrifices, but that doesn't mean that they will necessarily look poorly upon a smaller sacrifice. What should we sacrifice for this year's haurispicy reading?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.84.a:0 "Several birds."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.d1:0 "The shaman in charge of reading the omens was trembling when he reported back from the temple. Nervously, he informed us that the omens could not be interpreted in any other way, the gods were displeased and we did not have their favour. It appears as though bad times are ahead for us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.d2:0 "The shaman in charge of reading the omens appeared rather pleased as he reported back from the temple. The omens look good and the gods smile upon us. It seems as though our endeavors will be met with success."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.d3:0 "The shaman in charge of reading the omens was almost running from the temple to make his report. The omens were not just good, they were great! "The gods have assured me of our future success!" the shaman said, a large grin on his face."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.d4:0 "It seems as though the whole temple emptied as a wave of people rushed towards the palace. Luckily it was with incredible news, the omens could not have been better. "Success is not even a question milord!" one breathless shaman said, the others nodding in agreement."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.a:0 "We have been forsaken..."

The Fourth Path, 'Samyag Karman' or Right Action, says that we must not perform sensual misconduct, take that which is not ours, injure or kill. In many ways, Samyag Karman has made our nation stable and prosperous, but it does have its disadvantages. As not to displease the gods, monks in the [no_killing_province.GetName] province have been encouraging our subjects not to join the army. At first their influence was negligible, however, over time the word has spread and we are starting to feel the consequences."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.92.a:0 "Staying true to the Noble Path is an honorable endeavor."
    ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.92.a.tt:0 "Allow the men who want to follow the Noble Path to stay out of the army."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.92.b:0 "Their duty to our nation is greater than that to the gods!"

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.93.d:0 "In order to grow as human beings and approach spiritual liberation, we must earn merit. According to our teachings, we do so through prayer, diligence and devotion, and the accumulation of merit will carry over to our coming incarnations. The utmost sign of a good heart is the willing transfer of merit to others. This proves that we do not only perform prayer, diligence and devotion for our own benefit, but for that of everyone else as well.\n\nOur great ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], has arranged a great ceremony at the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family shrine. At the end [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will pass on the merit which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gathered during the ritual. Whom shall [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dedicate it to?"

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.94.d:0 "We have heard accounts of a lowborn man, possessing a calming presence and a way with words, while he also appears wise in the ways of philosophy. His fellow men treat him with the utmost respect, as if he were a trained shaman. A curiosity, the man shuns earthly possessions and never asks for more than the opportunity to preach his insight to others - in fact he has become something of a local attraction as people seek his aid in all sorts of matters, ranging between those of the heart to those of agriculture or civic duty. Some of the nobility argue that he'll start charging money for his advice any day now, while others see him as clearly meant for something other than spending the remainder of his life meditating in the local temple."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.95.d:0 "[bon_neighbor.GetName] have sent us a furious letter, informing us of a troublesome [Root.GetAdjective] monk selling books within their borders, while passing them off as sacred texts. Not only is it obviously counterfeit material, but the writing also contains several errors in regards to the Bön worldview, and the authorities in [bon_neighbor.GetName] are accusing us of trying to instigate religious riots in their streets. There is the argument that the monk was simply trying to explore his own philosophy, but considering the popularity of the writings in [bon_neighbor.GetName], it is reasonable to assume that this monk is indeed a charlatan using our faith to make money...\n\nThe damage already done, all we can do is send troops to find and escort the monk out of the country of [bon_neighbor.GetName]."
