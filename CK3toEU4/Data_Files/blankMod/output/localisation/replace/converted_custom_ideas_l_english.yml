 ZZZ_bon_temple_castles:3 "Fortified Monasteries"
 ZZZ_bon_temple_castles_desc:3 "Our order has long recognized that separating monasteries and defensive fortifications is a rather foolish idea. There is no reason that a monastery cannot be fortified to resist invaders and still be a tranquil place of prayer. Our monasteries are thus not only practical, but also large and intricate, the envy of all. This dual purpose also helps lower the cost as well since we are only building and maintaining one structure."

These would-be sacrifices needed to be captured alive, this meant that our soldiers needed to exercise a high level of constraint or risk angering the gods.

 ZZZ_stop_foreign_spies_desc:3 "Both our order and our subjects are all well known to be closely knit. Even in large towns, most people recognize one-another.

 ZZZ_canons_of_augustine_desc:3 "Unlike many of the other military holy orders, we do not follow the severe rules of the Benedictines of Cîteaux, instead we follow the milder Canons of St. Augustine. This has given us dual roles as both hospitallers and knights of a military order. We protect the pilgrims who travel to the shrines of saints, but we also help run many hospices. This, along with our right to marry has given us an excellent reputation of mildness and fairness to all."
 ZZZ_galleys_of_santiago:3 "The Galleys of Santiago"
 ZZZ_galleys_of_santiago_desc:3 "Our mission often requires us to take to the seas. However, many do not necessarily wish to voluntarily enter naval service.

A candidate who wished to join the order must have proved in his last four names that he, his parents and his grandparents were of noble descent by blood and not by privilege and had never worked in manual or industrial labor. An aspiring member could also not be descended from Jews, Muslims, Heretics, converts to Christianity regardless of how far removed they were. As time went on, the King and the Council of the Orders would abolish many of these requirements."

 ZZZ_or_else_desc:3 "Should an enemy accept our generous peace terms, we will treat them with the utmost civility. An enemy that fights well and surrenders when they have clearly lost is someone to respect. However, should one make the mistake of refusing our terms, we will ensure that the ruler and their nation will regret it. Our order has no tolerance for fools who do not understand when they have lost. If they do not lay down the sword, then we will lay down their sword for them, preferably through their body."

There are doomsayers who predict the demise of cavalry, but we know better. What needs to be done is modernizing the cavalry so that it does not fall behind in this arms race. As our ancestors learned how to master the art of using bows on the backs of horses, so too will we master the art of using guns on the backs of horses!"

With these findings in mind, we have reorganized our military to better take advantage of our position in order to build up our ranks."
 ZZZ_myrmidon_building:3 "Hellenic Glory"
 ZZZ_myrmidon_building_desc:3 "The Greeks built mighty temples and statues that were the envy of the world. The Romans built roads around the entirety of their empire along with building projects that could hardly be imagined today. As the custodians of that history, our order has made it a priority to continue the Greek and Roman traditions of building and development whenever possible."
 ZZZ_legacy_of_alexander:3 "Legacy of Alexander"
 ZZZ_legacy_of_alexander_desc:3 "When one speaks of the great people of history, one would be remiss to not talk about Alexander the Great, who destroyed all who stood before him and built an Empire that would not be rivaled in size until the Romans. Our order is proud to continue his tradition of expansion, bringing with us civilization!"

 ZZZ_coptic_defenders_desc:3 "For hundreds of years our order has been a bastion against the incursions of the Muslims. We alone have protected the faith our people even as we were cut off from our brothers and sisters in the north. Alone we have stood strong, and alone we shall continue to stand strong."
 ZZZ_go_far_copts:3 "Presence Abroad"
 ZZZ_go_far_copts_desc:3 "Rumors of our exploits have become legends even in lands far removed from our own. When our merchants go out, they are always pulled aside to be asked about the truthfulness of what they have heard. This has lead to an increased demand for our merchants. Even if the initial reason is for our stories, our excellent goods will surely make reason enough to allow our merchants to stay."
 ZZZ_order_in_every_town:3 "A Chapter in Every Town"
 ZZZ_order_in_every_town_desc:3 "We are more than just a holy order, we are a nation that governs over a vast number of peoples. This requires cooperation with local authorities and a spreading out of our numbers among our nation. By establishing a chapter house in every town, we can not only better administrate our people, but bring forward the recruitment numbers required to have so many chapter houses."
 ZZZ_mission_to_the_unknown:3 "Mission to the Unknown"
 ZZZ_mission_to_the_unknown_desc:3 "St. Anthony himself was known for going out into the wilderness and into the unknown. He braved conditions that would have killed many lesser men. We have done our upmost to honor his memory and our order has always held ascetism in high regard. Yet we are an order, and we have a mission to fulfill. We cannot just disappear into the wilderness, no, we must go into the unknown in order to spread the message of God. We shall go into the unknown, and there we will bring the Good News to those who have not yet heard it."
 ZZZ_capacity_for_more:3 "Fill The Ranks"
 ZZZ_capacity_for_more_desc:3 "As a military order it is imperative that we are able to protect our faithful brothers and sisters. We cannot do this if we do not have soldiers enough to protect them and drive back our enemies. We must re-organize our forces and audit our budget in order to create more opportunities for those who would join us to defend the order and its charges."
 ZZZ_coptic_gold:3 "Golden Experience"
 ZZZ_coptic_gold_desc:3 "Our order has been blessed with a history of gold. For centuries our order has handled and sometimes even mined for the metal that so many yearn for. Yet we ourselves have only the most base uses for it. As an ascetic order, we do not indulge in opulence or excess. As such, we know, better than many other nations, how to control the flow of gold and other precious items. We have restraint, and with restraint comes better economics."
 ZZZ_order_in_the_ranks:3 "Order in the Ranks"
 ZZZ_order_in_the_ranks_desc:3 "Our nation has become large and powerful, especially considering that we are a monastic order. Our numbers have swelled and recruitment could not be better, but we cannot allow this influx of new recruits to ruin our discipline. We must ensure that the training programs across our nation all maintain strict standards and practices. We cannot afford to be caught flat-footed by our enemies!"

 ZZZ_guardians_of_the_people_desc:3 "Our order was formed to protect three things, our traditions, our way of life and our people. The last is often the most important as we must stand firm against foreign invaders who would look to change our traditions and way of life as well as slaughter our people. As such, it is our job to be the bulwark that stands strong against all foreign powers. We will not shy away from the enemy, we will fight them head on."
 ZZZ_guardians_of_trade:3 "Guardians of Trade"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_trade_desc:3 "Our duties of guardianship extend beyond just the tombs and holy sorts guarded by our order. We also have a duty to protect all those who enter our land with no ill intent. This includes pilgrims, merchants and travelers. To these people we offer our protection, ensuring their safety and livelihoods. That this also boosts our general trading potential is only a side effect."
 ZZZ_guardians_of_spirit:3 "The Spirit Guardians"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_spirit_desc:3 "Our protection of the holy sites and ancestral burial tombs will never falter. Our own spirits have been tested in the rigorous initiation rites of our order and every member is stout of heart.

 ZZZ_guardians_of_the_arts:3 "Guardians of The Arts"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_the_arts_desc:3 "Our order recognizes the importance of the arts in regards to maintaining local customs and traditions.

All creative minds are welcome to visit our order."
 ZZZ_guardians_of_industry:3 "Guardians of Industry"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_industry_desc:3 "There are those who would attack fledgling businesses and technologies, deriding them as unnecessary and contrary to local tradition. Our order, however, understands that change is an essential part of any culture and that a refusal to do so is stagnation not greatness. What matters is keeping the essence of tradition, not staying unchanged forever. As such we encourage our people to try new things and branch out into different specialties."
 ZZZ_guardians_of_the_seas:3 "Guardians of the Sea"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_the_seas_desc:3 "As we look to protect our people at any cost, we cannot forget about the vast ocean. Our people travel by ship to locations all across the globe. Similarly, people come to our nation for a large variety of reasons by ship as well. We cannot allow these people to be subject to the horrors of piracy or foreign interference. We should take to the seas in order to continue our mission of guardianship!"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_all:3 "Guardians of All"
 ZZZ_guardians_of_all_desc:3 "Our order's sacred duty has always been to be the guardians of the people. As the world has evolves and we have expanded, we have come to the realization that our mandate needs expanding as well. Slavery, once an almost innocuous practice has become a most terrible thing. Long gone are the days of temporary slavery, slaves in the modern world are subjected to a lifetime of servitude that gets passed on to their children. As an order we can no longer condone this practice. Slavery must end, and our order must recognize the dignity of all peoples, regardless of background."

 ZZZ_large_order:3 "A Large Order"
 ZZZ_large_order_desc:3 "We are a military order. This in and of itself is not unusual, but what is unusual is the amount of land that we have under our control. Our order must not only follow their vows, but also govern the vast swaths of land under our control. True, not all of it is necessarily inhabited, but the distance from settlements is a challenge in its own right. Luckily, we have a developed an efficient system for the management of our land."
 ZZZ_kalevan_trade:3 "Trade Steering"
 ZZZ_kalevan_trade_desc:3 "Our order may not necessarily be in the thick of things as it were, but are location is surprisingly prime to force traders to go through us if they wish to get to other places around the world. As such, our order has a surprising amount of influence of where trade goes."
 ZZZ_cannon_hunters:3 "From Bows to Cannons"
 ZZZ_cannon_hunters_desc:3 "Understanding how to use a bow effectively is a difficult skill, requiring one to aim careful and take into account things like arrow drop and wind speed. Cannons are much the same way, just bigger, faster and better. Our expertise with bows in the past has begun to really come in handy as our nation modernizes with guns and cannons."
 ZZZ_convert_the_masses:3 "Convert the Masses"
 ZZZ_convert_the_masses_desc:3 "It may not necessarily be our most important priority, but the conversion of heathen and heretic subjects should still be something that we as an order focus on. By training more of our members to be well versed in theological arguments, we should be able to expand our efforts to convert our subjects to the true faith."
 ZZZ_vast_peoples:3 "An Array of Peoples"
 ZZZ_vast_peoples_desc:3 "Our order's vast holdings has given us access to a large variety of people with varying beliefs and lifestyles.

 ZZZ_take_down_the_walls_desc:3 "Our nation has been investing rather heavily in heavy artillery, and this has been working out wonderfully for our nation.

 ZZZ_warriors_read_books:3 "Learned Warriors"
 ZZZ_warriors_read_books_desc:3 "It is our order's strong belief that warriors that do not read books are failures of warriors.

 ZZZ_seasonal_warriors:3 "Seasonal Warrior"
 ZZZ_seasonal_warriors_desc:3 "The seasons and calendars of our faith are extremely important and every member of our order must know when to do what. This extends beyond the religious holidays and festivals that must be observed, each warrior must choose a trade and practice it. For this timing is crucial, a farmer must plant certain plants at different times, merchants need to be ready for certain seasons and animal breeders need to know when each animal goes into heat."
 ZZZ_one_nation:3 "Warriors of Conformity"
 ZZZ_one_nation_desc:3 "We are one nation, indivisible. Our order values conformity and we shall bring it to our people.

 ZZZ_protect_the_coasts_desc:3 "Our sacred duty is to protect the Jewish people from foreign invaders in order to ensure that their is never another diaspora.
