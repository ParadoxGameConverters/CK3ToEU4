 CK2_NAME:0 "Crusader Universalis"
 CK2_DESC:0 "The maps of Europe have changed since the 11th century. An ambitious player, perhaps a gift from God, perhaps a spawn of the Devil, drove the business of Europe towards one goal. But can this ambitious player control the unfolding of an entire planet for four more centuries without losing their supernatural qualities?"
 CK2A_NAME:0 "Once Upon A Time"
 CK2A_DESC:0 "The world remained unchanged during lengthy centuries. Even the most rebellious warmongers remained quiet and nobody tried to murder his neighbour. Yet this time of stagnation, a gift of a Devil for sure, has to end. Today, the 11th of November, in the year of our Lord 1444, the Renaissance began, a new movement that will destroy the eternal status quo."
