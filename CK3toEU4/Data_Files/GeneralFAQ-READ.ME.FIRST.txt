This FAQ is always current for all the converters. Please read it before you ask questions.

NOTE: As fas as we know, the converters do NOT support XBox/Gamepass installations, they cannot be used since user access to them is forbidden.

========== GENERAL QUESTIONS AND OPERATION ============

=== 1. Where do I download the latest converters from?

From GitHub (https://github.com/ParadoxGameConverters/). Always GitHub.
The Paradox forums (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/) and Steam Workshop mods we provide all point to GitHub.

=== 2. How do I unpack the converter?

Using any windows tool for unpacking .zip files. (Such as 7-Zip or WinRAR)

=== 3. Where do I unpack the converter?

Create a new folder on your Desktop or in your Documents Folder and unpack it there.
Do *NOT* unpack it into program files, or into your game installation folders.

=== 4. What game versions are supported?

Supported game versions are clearly stated next to download links and are inside every converter.
The converters will autodetect your game versions and will proceed only with compatible installations.

=== 5. How do I run/operate the converter?

Double-click ConverterFronted.exe.

In the Paths tab, there are several paths that you may have to fill (or they may auto-fill on their own).
Be sure to double-check these paths as the auto-fill may not always be correct.

= a) Path to a game installation - these are usually in your Steam or Epic games folders such as:

c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Europa Universalis IV

NOTE: XBox/Gamepass installations cannot be used.

= b) Path to a game's documents folder - these are usually in your user folder such as:

c:\Users\User\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV

= c) Path to your savegame - it is *always* within the game's user folder, such as:

c:\Users\User\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\save games\autosave.eu4

= d) Path to a game's mod folder - this is usually within user folder such as:

c:\Users\User\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod

with the Victoria 2 being only exception where mod folder is inside installation folder:

c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod

NOTE: Sometimes you may have to put the Victoria 2 mod in both the installation mod folder and the documents mod folder.

==

In the Mods tab (ck2toeu4 and vic2tohoi4 only) you must select the mods you used in that particular save.

In the Options tab select those options you wish. These are converter-specific.

Finally in the Convert Tab press the convert button. Wait until it reaches 109% or dies trying.

=== 6. How do I enable the produced conversion mod?

Step 1) In the launcher go to All Mods and see if the conversion mod is present. If it is not, restart the launcher and check again.
		If it is still not present, you likely exported to the wrong place. Check your mod folder and export path before doing anything else.

Step 2) In Playsets create a new playset. Using the Add Mods button adds the conversion mod to your new playset.

Step 3) On the Home tab of the launcher ENABLE that playset. Press Play.

NOTE: For HOI4 users if your map remains vanilla that is because your username contains non-ASCII characters, for example:
c:\Users\Hrčak Rašljvdžijanić\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV
HOI4 cannot load local mods from paths that contain such letters. Feel free to file more bug reports on hoi4 bug report subforum about this.

============ ERRORS AND ISSUES ====================

=== 1. The converter dies immediately producing nothing.

Download VC_redist.x64.exe from here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
Run VC_redist.x64.exe and retry once installed.

=== 2. The converter complains it cannot read configuration.txt, write configuration.txt or exports nothing.

Your Antivirus (most likely Avast or AVG) has blocked the converter from writing to the disk. Either disable it or whitelist the converter.

=== 3. Converter dies mid-conversion!

Step 1) Verify you have the latest converter.
Step 2) Verify your game installations.
Step 3) If all is normal but it still dies, we want to know about this issue so we can fix it. 

Go to the appropriate converter's forum thread and upload log.txt from the converter's folder.
Without log.txt we cannot help you.

=== 4. The converter produces an invalid conversion - provinces are all over the place or stuff makes no sense.

This can happen if province mapping files are outdated. We guarantee, for example, EU4->HPM->HOI4 will work since there's no HPM development.
GFM is less likely to work since it's an evolving mod.
Come to forums and upload screenshots with examples of the errors, your savegame and log.txt from the converter folder.

=== 5. I need more help about a game-specific issue.

Step 1) See if inside the converter's Docs/FAQ.txt and Docs/README.txt there is an answer to your question.
Step 2) Consult the wiki pages for the converters on the official PDX wiki.
Step 3) If all else fails, come to the forums and ask there. Be sure to explain in *detail* what is wrong, show screenshots if those can depict the issue,
		and always, always upload your conversion's log.txt.

FOR ANY OTHER ISSUES - Go to forums, explain the issue, upload log.txt.
Do NOT use Steam or Reddit or completely unrelated Discord servers trying to get help - those are all *wrong* places to seek assistance.
The only correct place is our converter-specific forum threads on the PDX forums.
