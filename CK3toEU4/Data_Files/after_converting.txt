Step One, sanity check:
1. Open log.txt
2. See if there are any warning due to missing cultures, religions, governments and similar.
3. Edit related maps in configurables/ folder and add the missing entries to appropriate files.
- These files are designed to be human-readable, easily editable, and players are encouraged to tinker with them.
4. Reconvert and be sure everything is  in place.

Step Two, testing:
1. Start the game with the converted mod.
2. Note all inconsistencies - look for wrong technology groups, missing country modifiers, anything that looks out of place.
3. Edit affected countries by manually editing files in the mod.
- common/ holds definitions for countries, religions, and cultures
- history/ holds actual map data - fell free to edit provinces to change owner, controller, culture or religion
 
 In case of major inconsistencies or problems, come to PDX forums and upload your save, explaining the problems.
 We're always open to suggestions and will fix whatever we can.
