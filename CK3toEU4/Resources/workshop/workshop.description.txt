[h1]CK3 To EU4 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the CK3 to EU4 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Crusader Kings 3 campaign to be transferred and continued in Europa Universalis 4, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 867 to 1821+, and further using our other converters from Imperator and to Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 4.

[h2]What is a converter?[/h2]

The converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i] (program, software, tool, app). It takes a saved game from one game and produces a mod for the other game, thus, bridging two games and allowing players to embark on grand [b]mega-campaigns[/b].

[h2]Where do I get it?[/h2]

You can download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-to-eu4-converter-release-thread.1415137/]forums thread[/url].

[h2]How does it work? How do I use the converter?[/h2]

Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/CK3_To_EU4_Converter]wiki page[/url].

Every converter also contains a file: GeneralFAQ-READ.ME.FIRST.txt

Inside this file there are detailed instructions and answers to a vast majority of user questions.

[h2]Other Questions, Troubleshooting, Contact[/h2] 

We welcome any questions and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. We will also answer any question not covered by the FAQ or wiki.

When seeking help, discussing conversion issues or problems, or if you simply need answers to your questions, come to our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-to-eu4-converter-release-thread.1415137/]forums forum release thread[/url].

To resolve issues we will always need your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Upload your log.txt to the release thread, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.

Keep in mind Steam discussion below is [b]not suited[/b] to troubleshooting as you cannot upload files we need.
