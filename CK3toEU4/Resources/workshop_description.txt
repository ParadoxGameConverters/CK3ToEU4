[h1]CK3 To EU4 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the CK3 to EU4 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Crusader Kings 3 campaign to be transferred and continued in Europa Universalis 4, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 867 to 1821+, and further using our other converters to Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from CK3 all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]Converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] Stable release of the converter currently supports EU4 1.9.3 and Crusader Kings 3 1.1. EU4 DLCs are optional, as are CK3 DLC.
[*] Development release of the converter is compatible with EU4 1.9.3
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-to-eu4-converter-release-thread.1415137/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start CK3 launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1158310\2241203093[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/CK3_To_EU4_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Crusader Kings 3 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Europa Universalis 4 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting EU4 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Start the EU4 Launcher. Click [i]Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Manage Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Initial playset[/i] and select [i]Add new playset[/i] (or select the playset you're currently using).
[*] For a fresh playset, directly select the converted mod. Otherwise, on an existing playset in the bottom right corner click [i]Add more mods[/i] and add it.
[/olist]

When resolving issues we will always need if your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion.

We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.
