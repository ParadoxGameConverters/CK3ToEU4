 HOLY_SITE_535_DESC:0 "The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD, and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then. The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa."
 HOLY_SITE_445_DESC:0 "Between the 6th (553) and 11th centuries AD, Merv served as the seat of an East Syrian metropolitan province, key in the Nestorian church's mission east up the Silk Road to Turkestan and China. In 1221 the city opened its gates to an invading Mongol horde; the resulting destruction of the city proved devastating. Historical accounts contend that the entire population (including refugees) of a million people were killed."
 HOLY_SITE_2308_DESC:0 "A Christian council was held at Edessa as early as 197. In 232, the Syriac Acts were written supposedly on the event of the relics of the Apostle Thomas being handed to the church in Edessa. Under Roman domination many martyrs suffered at Edessa: Sts. Scharbîl and Barsamya, under Decius; Sts. Gûrja, Schâmôna, Habib, and others under Diocletian. Christian priests from Edessa evangelized Eastern Mesopotamia and Persia, and established the first Churches in the kingdom of the Sasanians. Atillâtiâ, Bishop of Edessa, assisted at the First Council of Nicaea (325)."
 HOLY_SITE_700_DESC:0 "The Xi'an Stele, also known as the Nestorian Stele, reveals that the Church of the East had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635. According to the Stele, Alopen and his fellow Syriac missionaries came to China from Daqin (the Eastern Roman Empire) in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong (Tai Tsung) (635), bringing sacred books and images. Buried in 845, probably during religious suppression, the stele was not rediscovered until 1625."
