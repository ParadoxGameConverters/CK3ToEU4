This strictness towards lapsi is not a mainstream belief in any of the listed denominations. However, if we must choose one, the Catholic Church might be the closest in terms of its historical context and its emphasis on the sacrament of penance for those who have lapsed.

The Cathars, also known as Albigensians, were a medieval Christian sect that practiced a form of asceticism and were known for their belief in the dualistic nature of good and evil.
