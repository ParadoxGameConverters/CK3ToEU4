# This file relates to splitting off particularly large vassals into autonomous EU4 vassal states.
# To disable this behavior, disable vassal splitoff in frontend configuration options tab.
#
# Preamble: Everything below relates only to vassals of 1 tier lower than liege. For emperor kingdoms, for king duchies etc.
# By default, for a liege with 3 vassals, if any vassal has more than 100/3 + 10% = 43% clay, they will be split off.
# Ditto for 10 vassals, 100/10 + 10% = 20% clay is the limit.
# You can toggle sensitivity here, sensitivity 200 will halve the required percentages (21%, 10%),
# sensitivity 50 will double them (86%, 40%).
#
# Going overboard with sensitivity (<25, >300) will usually mean either no-one splits off or everyone splits off.
# It's capped to a range 1-1000.

sensitivity = 100

# Feel free to toy with the number until you achieve a result you're satisfied with.
# Please note that some special tags and types are immune to vassal splitoffs (pope(s), china, outremer, hordes, tribals).
